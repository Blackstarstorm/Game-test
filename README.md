## What's that Pokemon Type.

We currently have more that 800 Pokemon(807 officalily as of Sept 18, 2019). This app will make it so you can find Pokemon based on their types. Never again will you forget what type a pokemon is.

First I needed to find api, after getting the api I had to see what i was able to find with it. I choose pokemon types as a way to filter out pokemon then find a out where the names where located(type.pokemon.name)

Have fun and learn some more about the Pokemon you loved growing up and the newest one that joined the game.
